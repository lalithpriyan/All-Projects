Project: PowerBI | Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

Summary:
This project involved creating a dynamic Power BI dashboard to analyze emergency room data over a 19-month period (April 2023 â€“ October 2024). The dashboard provides actionable insights into patient trends, wait times, satisfaction scores, and demographic distributions. It highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) and allows stakeholders to make informed decisions to enhance patient care and resource allocation.

Client Requirements:
The client wanted to create an Emergency Room Dashboard to address the following requirements:
1. Primary KPIs: Number of patients, average wait time, and patient satisfaction scores for the selected period.
2. Efficiency Metrics: Percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes and distribution of referrals by department.
3. Demographics Analysis: Number of patients by age group, gender, and race.
4. Hourly and Weekly Trends: Patient distribution by day and hour to identify peak times and ensure staffing optimization.
5. Admission Insights: Analysis of admitted vs. non-admitted patients to identify trends in emergency care outcomes.

Stakeholders:
1. Hospital Management
2. Emergency Room Staff
3. Healthcare Analysts
4. Patient Experience Teams
5. Public Health Authorities
6. Insurance Providers
7. Local Government Health Departments

Steps in Project:
1. Requirement Gathering
2. Stakeholder Identification
3. Data Collection and Review

5. Data Connection and Modeling in Power BI
6. Designing Interactive Backgrounds in PowerPoint
7. Developing KPIs and Visuals
8. Dashboard Design and Interactivity
9. Insights Generation
10. Final Dashboard Presentation

Insights and Final Outcome:
1. The average wait time was 35.3 minutes, with a satisfaction score of 4.99 out of 10, indicating moderate satisfaction and areas for improvement.
2. Peak patient inflow occurred on Mondays (1,377 patients) and during late-night and early-morning hours, particularly 11 AM, 7 PM, 1 PM, and 11 PM.
3. Demographic analysis revealed the highest patient group to be adults aged 30-39 years (1,200 patients), followed closely by young adults aged 20-29 years (1,188 patients).
4. White patients (2,571) formed the largest racial group, followed by African Americans (1,951) and multi-racial individuals (1,557).
5. Departmental referrals were dominated by General Practice (1,840 cases) and Orthopedics (995 cases), while 5,400 patients did not require referrals.
6. Nearly half of the patients (4,612) were admitted, with the rest treated and released.

Key Takeaways:
1. The dataset highlights high patient volumes, moderate satisfaction levels, and common referrals to General Practice and Orthopedics.
2. Mondays and late-night to early-morning hours were identified as peak times, requiring additional staffing.
3. Demographics showed a diverse age and racial composition, aiding in targeted improvements to emergency services.
