Project: Excel | ELECTRIC VEHICLE DASHBOARD ANALYSIS

Summary:
This project involved creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze Electric Vehicle (EV – Electric Vehicle) trends in the United States. It highlights Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV – fully electric vehicles) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV – vehicles combining electric motors and internal combustion engines) adoption, state-wise distribution, and top EV manufacturers and models. The dashboard provides insights into market trends, technological advancements, and consumer preferences, aiding stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

Requirements:
The dashboard was designed to fulfill the following requirements:
1. Analyze total Electric Vehicles (EVs), Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
2. Calculate average electric range.
3. Visualize EV registrations by year and state.
4. Identify the top 10 vehicle makes and models.
5. Illustrate Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility distribution.

Stakeholders:
1. Electric Vehicle (EV) manufacturers
2. Government agencies
3. Policy advisors
4. Infrastructure companies
5. Consumers

Steps in Project:
1. Defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and chart requirements.
2. Cleaned data using Microsoft Excel.
3. Connected data to Tableau.
4. Built visualizations: line charts, maps, bar charts, and donut charts.
5. Created an interactive dashboard with filters.
6. Finalized and tested the dashboard.

Insights and Final Outcome:
1. Total Electric Vehicles (EVs): 1,50,422, with Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) at 77.61% and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) at 22.39%.
2. Average electric range: 67.83 km.
3. California leads Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption.
4. Tesla dominates with 53% of the market.
5. Tesla Model Y and Model 3 are the most popular vehicles.
6. 41.81% of vehicles are Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV)-eligible.
