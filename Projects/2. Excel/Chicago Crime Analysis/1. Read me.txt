Topic: Excel | Chicago Crime Analysis Dashboard

Summary:
This project involved creating an Excel-based interactive dashboard to analyze crime statistics in Chicago. The dashboard provides comprehensive insights into case filings, racial demographics of crime incidents, and detailed statute-based analysis. It enables law enforcement and city officials to track crime trends and make data-driven decisions for public safety initiatives.

3. Yearly Trends: Visualize case filing patterns across years.
4. Demographic Analysis: Show crime distribution by race.
5. Monthly Patterns: Track case filing trends throughout the year.
6. Top Crime Types: List the most frequent criminal charges.
7. Timeline Analysis: Enable year-wise filtering (2014-2023).
8. Race-based Filtering: Allow demographic-based data analysis.
